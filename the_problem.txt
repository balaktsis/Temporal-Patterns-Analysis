Given two event logs L1 and L2, discover temporal patterns that are frequently fulfilled in L1, but are frequently violated in L2. For example, L1 could consist of those cases where "customer was happy", and L2 could consists of those cases where "customer was dissatisfied". I want to find temporal patterns that are frequently fulfilled in those cases where the customer was satisfied, and frequently violated in the cases where the customer was dissatisfied.
